## Documentation

**If you followed the steps above so far, you already finished installing the dotfiles. Have fun!**

The below information is more for reference purposes.

There are 3 possible modes, listed be order of priority:

1. **Minimum mode**: it contains command prompt configuration.
2. **Personal mode**: it is the base configuration for any other Profiles.
3. **Work mode**: it is a derived Profile from the base, adding work email & other work related configurations.

> [!TIP]
> There is an automatic **Headless mode**: if `SSH_CLIENT` env var is detected during init, the headless mode installs .ssh/authorized_keys files.

> [!NOTE]
> The first step of installation will ask if you want a **Minimum mode** installation. The minimum mode only installs the needed dotfiles for the command prompt and is compatible with more distributions. It's also suitable for ephemeral environment.
> It will be enabled by default when running in a Dev Container.

### Convenience script

The [getting started](#getting-started) step used the [convenience script](./install.sh) to install this dotfiles. There are some extra options that you can use to tweak the installation if you need.

It supports some environment variables:

- `DOTFILES_USER`: Defaults to `owpac`.
- `DOTFILES_HTTPS_URL`: Defaults to `https://github.com/${DOTFILES_USER}/dotfiles.git`.
- `DOTFILES_SSH_URL`: Defaults to `"git@github.com:${DOTFILES_USER}/dotfiles.git`.
- `DOTFILES_DIR`: Defaults to `${HOME}/.dotfiles`.

For example, you can use it to clone and install the dotfiles repository in an other directory:

```console
DOTFILES_DIR=.chezmoi sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://get.owpac.com/dotfiles)"
```

### Installing without the convenience script

If you prefer not to use the convenience script to install the dotfiles, you can also do it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owpac/dotfiles "$HOME/.dotfiles"

"$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```
